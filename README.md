## Usage

1. [Get it while it's hot](https://github.com/lvillani/theine/releases).
2. Start the app and click the mug icon to enable/disable Theine. When the mug is empty, Theine is
   disabled. When it's full, your Mac won't sleep.

__NOTE__: The binary isn't signed.


## Don't We Have Caffeine Already?

Theine is better than [Caffeine](http://lightheadsw.com/caffeine/) in a number of ways:

* The monochrome icon blends in nicely with OS X Yosemite.
* Uses [power assertions](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/IOKit/Reference/IOPMLib_header_reference/) to keep your Mac awake.
* Open source.
* Tea is supposedly better than coffee.
